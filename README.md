# csv-timesheet-calculator

--------------------------------------------

Piece of accounting sofware written for a restaurant that I work at.

--------------------------------------------

This program allows the user to drop in a CSV file which contains over 20 employees and their hours worked - the CSV counts hours per day, so this program will return a list of each employee and their total hours worked for the week rounded to the closest 15 minutes.

--------------------------------------------

Written fully by me in Python.
